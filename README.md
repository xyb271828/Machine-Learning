# Machine Learning Programming Assignment

This repository contains code and documentation for a machine learning programming implemented in Python using scikit-learn.  
It includes both regression and classification tasks designed to illustrate model construction, training, evaluation, and visualization.

# Overview

The assignment is divided into two main parts:

1. Regression Task
   Polynomial regression with and without regularization (Lasso and Ridge) to model non-linear data relationships.
2. Classification Task
   A CIFAR-10–based image classification model that distinguishes between **dogs** and **horses** using PCA for dimensionality reduction and LDA (or QDA/KNN) for classification.
